*** Hardware
--> order parts...
--> Bi-dir lev transl for Reset?
--> change out 7406 with something 3.3v powered, non-inverting 
    ie 74LCX07 or 74LVC07
--> remaining control signals (IRQ, NMI, etc)

  drive data bus to set latches for IO set such as... (or access more Teensy IO, or IO expander, etc)
     Kernal/BASIC/Char Set controls (5 bits)
  
  batt back for USB
  test SD port
  Ethernet port?
  USB host port?
  
  Jupiter Lander still has garbled video...
  
*** Software
C64 code:
-->exit to basic (for PRG run, etc) should unassert game/exrom
--> options (funct keys): Exit to BASIC, Load from USB Host/SD/USB Drive
  transfer program/cart via USB
  SD access, USB thumb drive?
  
  assembly test program?
  Verify T41 speed on compile or setup()?   
      overclock even needed?
  Read c64 bus speed, adjust for PAL(?)

more program options to load:
1- EPYX fast load routine (just fast load routine for drive 8, not full cart version)

These take the same amount of memory:
