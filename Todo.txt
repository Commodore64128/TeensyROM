*** Hardware
--> ordered parts...  try 74LCV07 (maybe?)
  drive data bus to set latches for IO set such as... (or access more Teensy IO, or IO expander, etc)
     Kernal/BASIC/Char Set controls (5 bits)

PCB Design:
  batt back for RTC?
  test SD port
  Ethernet port?
  USB host port?
  
  
*** Software
C64 code:
-->   transfer program/cart file via USB
  Load from USB Host, SD card, USB thumb Drive
  Get time from internet
  
  default music state (on/off) saved in t4 internal eeprom
  Jupiter Lander still has garbled video, 80 col PRG doesn't work...
  add (find) EPYX fast load routine (fast load routine for drive 8?, not full cart version)
  
  TeensyROM test program? (IO1/2, other ROM locations, etc)
  Verify T41 speed on compile or setup()?   
      overclock even needed?
  Read c64 bus speed, adjust for PAL(?)



*** notes
These take the same amount of memory:
//PROGMEM  prog_uchar testpat[] = {
//Memory Usage on Teensy 4.1:
//  FLASH: code:26828, data:*7328, headers:*8848   free for files:*8083460
//   RAM1: variables:7936, code:24280, padding:8488   free for local variables:483584
//   RAM2: variables:12384  free for malloc/new:511904
//
//static const uint8_t testpat[] = {
//Memory Usage on Teensy 4.1:
