*** Hardware
--> order parts...
--> remaining control signals(IRQ) Leave disconnected or
-->      Bi-dir lev transl for Reset?

-->Make Reset In from button only (as currently implemented) Use spare buffer for IRQ.
  drive data bus to set latches for IO set such as... (or access more Teensy IO, or IO expander, etc)
     Kernal/BASIC/Char Set controls (5 bits)

PCB Design:
  batt back for RTC?
  test SD port
  Ethernet port?
  USB host port?
  
  Jupiter Lander still has garbled video...
  
*** Software
C64 code:
--> options (funct keys): Exit to BASIC, Load from USB Host/SD/USB Drive
  transfer program/cart via USB
  SD access, USB thumb drive?
  
  default music state (on/off) saved in t4 internal eeprom
  Get time from internet
  
  
  assembly test program?
  Verify T41 speed on compile or setup()?   
      overclock even needed?
  Read c64 bus speed, adjust for PAL(?)

more program options to load:
1- EPYX fast load routine (just fast load routine for drive 8, not full cart version)


*** notes
These take the same amount of memory:
//PROGMEM  prog_uchar testpat[] = {
//Memory Usage on Teensy 4.1:
//  FLASH: code:26828, data:*7328, headers:*8848   free for files:*8083460
//   RAM1: variables:7936, code:24280, padding:8488   free for local variables:483584
//   RAM2: variables:12384  free for malloc/new:511904
//
//static const uint8_t testpat[] = {
