*** Hardware
   Potential Changes from 0.1 PCB:

      drive local data bus to latched outputs such as Kernal/BASIC/Char Set controls (5 bits)
            via 74LVC573 Need 1 Teensy IO line per latch
      access more Teensy IO pins by muxing inputs via 74LVC257s
            8 inputs reduce to 5
            16 inputs reduce to 9
            24 inputs reduce to 13 (frees up 11 IOs)
      
      batt back for RTC?
      Ethernet port?
      USB host port?
  
  
*** Software
C64 code:
-->   transfer program/cart file via USB
  Load from USB Host, SD card, USB thumb Drive
  Get time from internet, display in app
  Add HES mon & Joust to internal loads
  
  default music state (on/off) saved in t4 internal eeprom
  Jupiter Lander still has garbled video, 80 col PRG doesn't work...
  add (find) EPYX fast load routine (fast load routine for drive 8?, not full cart version)
  
  TeensyROM test program? (IO1/2, other ROM locations, etc)
  Verify T41 speed on compile or setup()?   
      overclock even needed?
  Read c64 bus speed, adjust for PAL(?)



*** notes
These take the same amount of memory:
//PROGMEM  prog_uchar testpat[] = {
//Memory Usage on Teensy 4.1:
//  FLASH: code:26828, data:*7328, headers:*8848   free for files:*8083460
//   RAM1: variables:7936, code:24280, padding:8488   free for local variables:483584
//   RAM2: variables:12384  free for malloc/new:511904
//
//static const uint8_t testpat[] = {
//Memory Usage on Teensy 4.1:
